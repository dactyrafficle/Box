

p2 is anchored to p1 at a distance of r


* p1 changes position

* recalculate the vector between p1 and p2, A

* reposition p2 along the new vector A, at a distance of r

* from the total forces accumulated on p2, take the component perpendicular to A

* this perpendicular force exerts angular acceleration, imposing an angular velocity, and changing the angle between p1 and p2

* calculate the new angle theta between p1 and p2

* calculate the new position of p2
